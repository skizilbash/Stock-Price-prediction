Deep Learning LSTM Recurrent Neural network model to predict stock price

Recurrent Neural Networks are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and among others used by Apples Siri and Googles Voice Search. This is because it is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for Machine Learning problems that involve sequential data. It is one of the algorithms behind the scenes of the amazing achievements of Deep Learning in the past few years.

keras with tensorflow backend is used for the case study
